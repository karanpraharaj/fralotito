So.. this is a black hole. It's pretty cool, isn't it?

Specifically, this is the supermassive black hole inside the core of _Messier 87_ (M87), a giant elliptical galaxy located in a constellation called Virgo. 

The black hole in the center of M87, let's call it _M87*_, is about 53 million light-years away from us, and it's much larger than the black hole in the center of our own galaxy: _Sagittarius A*_ (26k light-years from Earth). In fact, models predict that _M87*_ has a mass between 3 to 6 billion solar masses resulting in a event horizon of $GM/c^2 = 8.9 \times 10^{12}$ to $1.8 \times 10^{13}$ meters in size while _Sagittarius A*_ has a mass of "only" 4 million solar masses and an event horizon of $GM/c^2 = 1.2 \times 10^{10}$ meters in size.

These black holes are supermassive, meaning they reside at the center of galaxies and are millions to billions of solar masses in size. Although these targets are not necessarily the closest of all known black holes to Earth, due to their massive size, their predicted event horizon appears the largest to us on the sky. It's predicted that these black holes would appear as a small ring of light on the sky, roughly 20-50 $Âµ$-arcseconds in size. This is about the same size to us on Earth as an orange on the surface of the Moon.
